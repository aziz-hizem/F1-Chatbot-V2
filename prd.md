# **Project Requirements Document: F1 Information Chatbot**

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the F1 Information Chatbot system.

| Requirement ID | Description               | User Story                                                                                       | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Driver Information Query  | As a user, I want to ask about driver statistics so I can get accurate career data.              | The system should be able to provide complete driver stats (wins, championships, teams, etc...) according to what's demanded by user when queried about specific drivers.            |
| FR002          | Race Results Query        | As a user, I want to ask about past race results so I can see specific Grand Prix events. | The system should return according to what's demanded : race winners, podium finishers, fastest lap times, constructor standings, driver standings and key race statistics when given a race/year combination.          |
| FR003          | Team Performance Query    | As a user, I want to ask about constructor/team performance so I can compare teams.              | The system should provide team statistics (championships, wins) and current driver lineups when queried about teams.          |
| FR004          | Championship History      | As a user, I want to ask about championship winners so I can understand historical performance.  | The system should return complete championship standings (all drivers/all constructors) for any given season.                         |
| FR005          | Circuit Information       | As a user, I want to ask about race circuits so I can learn about track characteristics.         | The system should provide circuit details (location, lap record, circuit length) when queried about specific tracks.          |
| FR006          | Head-to-Head Comparisons  | As a user, I want to compare drivers/teams so I can analyze performance differences.             | The system should generate comparative statistics when asked to compare two drivers/teams/seasons.                            |
| FR007          | Natural Language Queries  | As a user, I want to ask questions conversationally so I don't need to use specific commands.     | The system should understand questions phrased in natural language and return accurate responses conversationally also.                              |
| FR008          | Multi-Year Trends         | As a user, I want to ask about performance trends so I can see evolution over time.              | The system should generate time-based comparisons (e.g., "Mercedes wins 2014-2021") when asked about multi-year periods.      |
| FR009          | Error Handling            | As a user, I want clear error messages so I understand when information isn't available.         | The system should provide helpful responses when data is unavailable, suggesting alternative queries or explaining limitations. |
| FR010          | Response Formatting       | As a user, I want well-formatted responses so I can easily read the information.                 | The system should return information in clear, organized formats (tables for stats, paragraphs for explanations).             |
| FR011          | Follow-up Questions       | As a user, I want to ask follow-up questions so I can dive deeper into topics.                   | The system should maintain context during conversations to enable natural follow-up questions without repetition.             |
